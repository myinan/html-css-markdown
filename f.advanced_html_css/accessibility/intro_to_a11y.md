# Introduction to Web Accessibility
## What is web accessibility?
Web accessibility means that websites, tools, and technologies are designed and developed so that people with disabilities and other circumstantial limitations can use them with as few barriers as possible.

There are different types of disabilities, including (but not limited to) auditory, physical/motor, cognitive, or visual. A disability can be permanent, such as a user who is completely blind or deaf, or it can be temporary, such as a user with a broken arm. Users can have multiple disabilities at any given time. Older users with changing abilities may even have similar conditions as those who have a disability.

Situational limitations are a little different. Using a phone outside on a bright day, browsing a site with one hand while you’re busy doing something else with the other, or living in an area where the internet is slow or the bandwidth is expensive are all examples of situational limitations. These limitations, unlike a disability, occur to users only in specific situations, but are still important to keep in mind when developing a website.

## Why web accessibility matters
Let’s first look at a non-web example to gain a little perspective. Imagine being in a multi-storied building that has no elevator. For some people, this might only be an annoyance. “Huh, no elevator. I guess I’ll walk up a few flights of stairs, then.” A person that requires a wheelchair, however, would find it impossible, or at the very least much more difficult, to go anywhere beyond the first floor. Even if a person in a wheelchair had someone to lift the wheelchair up each step, it would be a much more difficult process. The point here is that an elevator would have made this building more accessible.

The building is your website, and the elevator is a collection of various accessibility features and tools (…it’s a pretty big elevator). When you develop a website, you’re developing it for users, and you need that website to actually be usable by them. People with disabilities, older people with changing abilities, people who aren’t as tech savvy, and people with some sort of situational limitation are still users, and websites should be as equally usable by them as possible.

One other pretty big reason that accessibility matters is that, depending on the country, there could actually be laws *requiring* accessibility to be implemented.

### Knowledge Check

**Q1.** What is web accessibility?

**A1.** Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of designing and developing websites and web applications that can be used and accessed by people with disabilities. This means ensuring that all users, regardless of their physical or cognitive abilities, can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with the content and functionalities of a website.

Key principles of web accessibility include:

1. **Perceivable**: Information and user interface components must be presented in ways that users can perceive. This includes providing text alternatives for non-text content, such as images, audio, and video, ensuring that content is easy to see and hear, and allowing users to adjust the presentation of content.

2. **Operable**: Users must be able to operate the interface and navigate the website effectively. This involves making all functionality available from a keyboard, providing sufficient time for users to read and use content, avoiding content that could cause seizures, and providing navigational aids.

3. **Understandable**: The content and operation of the website must be understandable. This includes using clear and simple language, providing predictable and consistent navigation, and helping users avoid and correct mistakes.

4. **Robust**: The website must be robust enough to work with current and future assistive technologies. This means using technologies that are compatible with accessibility standards, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and ensuring that the website remains functional as technologies evolve.

Web accessibility is not only a moral and ethical imperative but also a legal requirement in many jurisdictions. Failure to make websites accessible can exclude a significant portion of the population from accessing information, services, and opportunities available online. Therefore, businesses and organizations are increasingly recognizing the importance of prioritizing web accessibility in their digital strategies.

**Q2.** Who truly benefits from accessibility features?

**A2.** Accessibility features benefit a wide range of individuals, not only those with disabilities. Here are some groups that benefit from accessibility features:

1. **People with Disabilities**: This includes individuals with visual impairments, hearing impairments, mobility impairments, cognitive disabilities, and other disabilities. Accessibility features enable them to access and interact with digital content and services effectively.

2. **Elderly Individuals**: As people age, they may experience changes in their abilities, such as decreased vision, hearing loss, or reduced motor skills. Accessibility features make it easier for older adults to use digital technologies comfortably and independently.

3. **Temporary Disabilities**: Temporary disabilities, such as a broken arm or temporary vision impairment due to eye surgery, can affect anyone at any time. Accessibility features provide support for individuals experiencing temporary limitations.

4. **People with Situational Limitations**: Situational limitations, such as using a mobile device in bright sunlight or trying to access content without sound in a noisy environment, can hinder user experience. Accessibility features make digital content more usable in various situations.

5. **Users in Low-Resource Environments**: In regions with limited internet connectivity or older devices, accessibility features can help improve the usability of websites and applications by reducing the amount of data transferred, optimizing performance, and ensuring compatibility with older hardware and software.

6. **Non-Native Language Speakers**: Users who are not fluent in the language used on a website or application may struggle to understand complex language or terminology. Clear and simple language, one of the principles of web accessibility, benefits these users.

7. **Search Engines and Assistive Technologies**: Accessibility features also benefit search engines, screen readers, voice assistants, and other assistive technologies by providing structured, well-labeled content that can be easily interpreted and navigated.

8. **Businesses and Organizations**: By prioritizing accessibility, businesses and organizations can reach a broader audience, improve user satisfaction, and enhance their brand reputation. Additionally, accessibility features often improve overall usability for all users, leading to increased engagement and conversion rates.

Overall, accessibility features have a far-reaching impact, making digital content and services more inclusive, usable, and beneficial for everyone, regardless of their abilities or circumstances.
