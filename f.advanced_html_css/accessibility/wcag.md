# The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) are a set of technical standards and guidelines published by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) to ensure that digital content, particularly on the web, is accessible to people with disabilities. The WCAG exist in order to help create a shared standard when it comes to web accessibility. These guidelines provide recommendations for making web content more accessible to users who may have visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, or neurological disabilities.

### The four principles
The WCAG are organized around four, core principles (POUR) that should be kept in mind when implementing any sort of accessibility feature:

1. **Perceivability:** Ensuring that information and user interface components are presented in a way that users can perceive, regardless of their sensory abilities.For example, light text on a light background could be difficult for some users with a visual impairment to perceive.

2. **Operability:** Ensuring that user interface components and navigation are operable, allowing users to interact with the content using different input modalities. Users must be able to operate any user interfaces or navigation, and interfaces cannot require an interaction which the user cannot perform. A navigation bar with drop-down menus that only expand when a mouse cursor hovers over them, for example, would not be operable by keyboard users giving those menu items focus.

3. **Understandability:** Making content understandable and predictable for users, including those with cognitive disabilities or limited language proficiency. Users must be able to understand any information or user interface that is presented to them. For example, if a user tried submitting a form and received an error such as “Error 113: Bad data”, they wouldn’t be able to understand what the error actually means or how to fix whatever caused the error.

4. **Robustness:** Ensuring that web content is compatible with current and future user agents, including assistive technologies such as screen readers and voice recognition software.

### Conformance levels
The WCAG has three different conformance levels, each of which is made up of various success criteria, or rules, that must be followed in order to successfully meet that level of conformance.

The three levels of conformance are: **A (minimum)**, **AA (mid-range)**, and **AAA (highest)**. Conformance with WCAG is increasingly stringent from level A to level AAA, with AA being the commonly targeted level for most websites and digital content.

These guidelines are essential for creating an inclusive digital environment, ensuring that everyone, regardless of ability, can access and interact with online content effectively. They are widely recognized and adopted by governments, organizations, and businesses worldwide as the standard for web accessibility.

## WCAG 2.2
The WCAG 2.2 has 13 guidelines. The guidelines are organized under 4 principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.

For each guideline, there are testable success criteria. The success criteria are at three levels: A, AA, and AAA.

WCAG 2.0, 2.1, and 2.2 are designed to be “backwards compatible”, which means content that conforms to WCAG 2.2 also conforms to WCAG 2.1 and WCAG 2.0. If you want to meet the all versions, you can use the WCAG 2.2 resources and you don’t need to bother looking earlier versions.

W3C encourages you to use the most recent version of WCAG.

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2 is a stable, referenceable technical standard **([Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/))**. Though when developing web content and web tools, most people will use the documents introduced below, instead of the actual standard document.

Also, even though it's not W3C material, the following website does a good job at presenting a "checklist" aimed at comforming to WCAG 2.2 standards.
