# Introduction to Web Development
## 3 Web Dev Careers Decoded: Front-End vs Back-End vs Full Stack
### **What is a Front-End Developer?**
The front-end of a website is the part that users interact with. Everything that you see when you’re navigating around the Internet, from fonts and colors to dropdown menus and sliders, is a combo of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript being controlled by your computer’s browser.
### **Skills and Tools Required for Front-End Development**
Front-end developers are responsible for a website’s user-facing code and the architecture of its immersive user experience design. In order to execute those objectives, front-end devs must be adept at three main languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript programming. 

In addition to fluency in these languages, front-end devs need to be familiar with frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, Backbone, AngularJS, ReactJs and EmberJS, which ensure great-looking content no matter the device, and libraries like jQuery and LESS, which package code into a more useful, time-saving form. 

A lot of front-end developer job listings also call for experience with Ajax, a widely used technique for using Javascript that lets pages dynamically load by downloading server data in the background.

A front-end dev is responsible for the interior design of a house that’s been built by a back-end dev.
### **What is a Back-End Developer?**
So what makes the front-end of a website possible? Where is all that data stored? This is where the back-end comes in. The back- end of a website consists of a server, an application, and a database. 

A back-end developer builds and maintains the technology that powers those components which, together, enable the user-facing side of the website to even exist in the first place.
### **Skills and Tools Required for Back-End Development**
In order to make the server, application, and database communicate with each other, back-end devs use server-side languages like PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, and .Net to build an application, and tools like MySQL, Oracle, and SQL Server to find, save, or change data and serve it back to the user in front-end code. 

Job openings for back-end developers often also call for experience with PHP frameworks like Zend, Symfony, and CakePHP; experience with version control software like SVN, CVS, or Git; and experience with Linux as a development and deployment system.
### **What is a Full Stack Developer?**
The idea is that a full stack developer can work cross-functionally on the full “stack” of technology, i.e. both the front end and back end. Full stack developers offer the full package.
### **Skills and Tools Required for Full Stack Developers**
Full stack developers work, like back-end devs, on the server side of web programming, but they can also fluently speak the front-end languages that control how content looks on a site’s user-facing side. They’re jacks-of-all-trades.

# Asking For Help
## Tips for Getting the Best Help Possible
+ Always Provide Your Code and the Surrounding Context
+ Ask About the Problem at Hand, Not the Solution Itself

### Knowledge Check
**Q1.** Name at least one thing your question should always include:

**A1.** It should include accurate information of what your problem at hand is rather than the possible solution you think will work. If it's a coding question, include the piece of code you're trying to solve.

**Q2.** Describe the “XY Problem”:

**A2.** "XY Problem" is asking about a solution or problem "Y" when in reality your problem is actually "X". This causes confusion and waste of time.

**Q3.** Describe three attributes of a “help vampire”:

**A3.**
+ They don't put in reasonable effort into solving their problem.
+ They don't try researching and googling possible solutions first.
+ They are not interested in expanding their knowledge on the subject, they are looking for someone else to do their job.
