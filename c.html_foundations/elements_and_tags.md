# Elements and Tags

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) defines the structure and content of webpages. We use HTML elements to create all of the paragraphs, headings, lists, images, and links that make up a typical webpage.

## Elements and Tags
Almost all elements on an HTML page are just pieces of content wrapped in opening and closing HTML tags.

Opening tags tell the browser this is the start of an HTML element. They are comprised of a keyword enclosed in angle brackets <>. For example, an opening paragraph tag looks like this: \<p>

Closing tags tell the browser where an element ends. They are almost the same as opening tags; the only difference is that they have a forward slash before the keyword. For example, a closing paragraph tag looks like this: \</p>

There are some HTML elements that do not have a closing tag. These elements often look like this: \<br/> or \<img/>, but some can also be used without the closing forward slash such as \<br> or \<img>. These are known as self-closing tags or empty elements because they donâ€™t wrap any content.

HTML has a vast list of predefined tags that you can use to create all kinds of different elements. It is important to use the correct tags for content. Using the correct tags can have a big impact on two aspects of your sites: how they are ranked in search engines; and how accessible they are to users who rely on assistive technologies, like screen readers, to use the internet.

Using the correct elements for content is called semantic HTML.

### Knowledge Check

**Q1.** What is an HTML tag?

**A1.** HTML tags are "labels" used in Hypertext Markup Language(HTML) to label content in a way which is both readible by machines and semantically meaningful to humans. When rendering and displaying an HTML page, web browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML tags are used to label content. A tag is contained within brackets (like \<br>) and we wrap the content we want to label with an open tag (like \<div>) and a closed tag (like \</div>).

**Q2.** What are the three parts of an HTML element?

**A2.** An HTML element is usually structured as follows: \<opening-tag>Content\</closing-tag>
