# Text Editors

A text editor is by far the most used developer tool regardless of what type of developer you are. 
A good text editor can help you write better code with real-time code checking, syntax highlighting, and automatic formatting.

## Why can’t I use Microsoft Word?
Rich text editors, such as Microsoft Word and Libre-Office Writer, are great for writing a paper, but the features that make them good at creating nicely formatted documents make them unsuitable for writing code. <br>
A document created with these rich text editors has more than just text embedded in the file. <br>
These files also contain information on how to display the text on the screen and data on how to display graphics embedded into the document. <br>
In contrast, plain text editors, such as VSCode and Sublime, don’t save any additional information. <br>

**Saving only the text allows other programs, like Ruby’s interpreter, to read and execute the file as code.**

## Code Editors
A text editor is comparable to a code editor; however, a code editor offers significantly more functionality. <br>
Text editors with sophisticated built-in capabilities and specific functionalities designed to ease and speed up the process of editing code are referred to as code editors. <br>
